Notes:
 - This project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - This program seems to be working as intended, but has had very limited testing. It is still considered experimental at this stage, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work correctly. You should vet the code before using it! For me, making this project was more about learning how to use AI tools than the actual project itself.
